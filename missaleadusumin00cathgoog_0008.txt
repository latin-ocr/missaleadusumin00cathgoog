15. (of which many co ies exist) represents three other classes of
editions-first, 3., second y, the two Rouen editions of 8. and that of
9. (these three editions have much in common); and thirdly, the
Rouen editions of 14. and 21.

When this edition of the Missal was begun, it was conceived that
twenty edition„ that of 1510 and 11 (designatae by 1ὲ) 13.,14P. and

lo

27ΡΡ. (of which nineteen copies are known to exist), 16P., 19PH.‚
29. and 33. (of which sixteen copies are known), 21P., 26., 27Α., 27Β.,
28. <of which fifteen copies romain), and 31„ 32„ 34„ ἕξ, 55P.,
55L., 55V. (of which thirty-four exist), differed very slightly from
one· another ; as well as 19PR., 27PR., 30„ and 54R. (of which fifteen

one another and might be taken as a kind of common standard edition.
Circumstances also pointed out 26. as the edition most convenient to
print from. But as the work went on, it was found that differenees
greater than had been anticipated existed between 13. and 26. and
55P. ; and all that at present can be said is that 13. is believed to

represent the first set of editions and (probably) the second3 and that
26. represents the third, and the fourth also—where it is not noted
that 551³. differs from it.

The four Pynson editions, 0L., 4L., 12., and 20. have some features
in common, sufficient to warrant the classing them together, along ,
with the last edition, that of 57. and perhaps ΟΡ. In the notes,
where 4L. and 57. agree, they probably represent this class.

The collations for this edition have been made by comparing
together 94. and 57„ 13. and 8RM.; and the Gradual with 4L. In
these collationS, no notice was taken of the variations in the Epistles
and Gospels. While the work was in progress, 551³. was compared
with 98. and 13.; and the results of all these collations compared
afterwards with 92., 97., 15. and 26.

There remain 2., 4ΡΗ., 16R., 19PO., and possibly one or two
more doubtful books given in the list ublished originally in the
Eccleeioloqiet in 1850 and subsequent y in a separate form by
Masters, of which no account can be given. Others also may be
found. The Rev. J. O. Jackson has a large fragment of a Missal
which is not the same with any one of those examined with a view
to this edition.

It may be as well to remark, that the reference letter or mark of
each of the notes at the bottom of the page is placed in the text at
the beginning and end of the word or passage to which the note
gtilves ain alternati-›veb3 and {ivettiltiles of¹3 course in the longer noteS,

Generally speaking, in {he text an invelrsigon of words, and in the
rubrics of the Missal and Gradual a variation of phraseology, when
the meaning was obviously the same, have not been noticed‚ that
reading being given which appeared to have the best authority.
