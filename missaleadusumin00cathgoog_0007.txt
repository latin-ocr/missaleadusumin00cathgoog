ΙΨ is intended to give ‘the particulars of what is known of the
editions of the Sarum Missal, and any other information that may
be available, when the work is completed.

Meanwhile, it is only necessary to explain that the editions of
which use ‘has been made in the present work are designated by the
year of publication ; ’“ 92 ” meaning the edition of 1492 ; “ 34 ’' that
of 1534, and so forth. When more than one edition was printed in
the same year, they are distinguished bytho initial of the place of
publication placed after the date3 and when there is ambiguity
also as to the place, the initial of one of the printers or publishers
follows; where no name of place occurs, the initial of the printer is
given. Thus, the edition printed in 1527 at Paris by Prevost is
{ffizessffi,gysaffly'gffiagnffiglnffiffl'gz'wgssffnffltbssffiyffffig ,ἓξὲξ
no designation of place, by 27A. and 27Β. At the end of the copy
of the last mentioned edition, which is in the British Museum‚
occur 3, few leaves of a different edition, which have been designated
for convenience 271. .

When an edition bears two dates, it is denoted by a fraction z the

edition begun in 1510 and ended in 1511 is denoted by ᾖξε so

likewise *ἐξ denotes the edition printed in 1554 and 1555.

M54. denotes the Sarum Manual of that year3 P with 3, figure
following it, is the Sarum Processional of the year indicated3 and
B56. is the small Breviary of that year, printed at Paris.

Before this edition was begun, 3, comparison of editions was made,
sufficient to show a probable division into four or five classes, and
some minor subdivisions. In the noteS, only one edition of each
class has been mentioned, except when it was observed that one
edition differed from others of the same class.

Wherever in the notes 94 occurs, the folio and the quarto printed
at Venice in 1494 are represented, and also the very curious folio
without date or place, (probably earlier than the above editions) in
the Gough Collection at the Bodleian and at the British Museum‚
This book, when it is referred to separately, is marked H.

in the British Museum‚ and belonging to the Duke of Devonshire>

at Cambridge, 8V. in the Gough Collection, and loR. in the Bodleian
and belonging to Mr Mendham, as well as 271, before referred to,
